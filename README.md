# Company Coding Journey

## Introduction

The **Company Coding Journey** repository is a curated collection of solutions, notes, and resources aimed at supporting software engineers preparing for technical coding interviews at top companies. This repository documents the learning path, challenges, and solutions encountered during the coding interview preparation process. It covers a variety of topics, including data structures, algorithms, system design, and more, offering a comprehensive guide for anyone aiming to crack coding interviews.

## Configuration

Configuration is straightforward and primarily involves setting up your environment to run code samples and access the included notebooks and scripts. The repository may contain code in multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, or JavaScript. Users should ensure they have the necessary compilers or interpreters installed. For Python, a recommended approach is to use a virtual environment and install dependencies using `pip`. Configuration files or environment variable requirements, if present, will be described within individual directories or files.

## Requirements

To get the most out of this repository, ensure you have the following:

- **Git** for cloning the repository.
- **Python 3.x** (if Python scripts or notebooks are included).
- **pip** for managing Python packages.
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional but recommended for .ipynb files).
- **Other language compilers** (such as Java or C++) if solutions are provided in those languages.
- **IDE or text editor** like VS Code, PyCharm, or IntelliJ IDEA.
- **Internet access** for installing dependencies and accessing external resources.

Check for a `requirements.txt` or similar file in the project root or subfolders for a list of required Python packages.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the repository locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sathwik13198/company-coding-journey.git
   cd company-coding-journey
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (if using Python):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If dependencies are organized per folder, navigate to the respective directory and install them accordingly.

4. **Set up Jupyter Notebook (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Compile or set up other languages/environments as needed, following instructions in individual folders or README files.**
